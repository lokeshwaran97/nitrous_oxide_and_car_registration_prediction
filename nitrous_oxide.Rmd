## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#add library ggplot which is used to plot graphs
library(ggplot2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#import the file using read.csv function
df = read.csv("a23_nox.csv")

```

```{r}
#new attribute cale data class is created the values of this attribute will be a date class 
df$date_class = as.Date(df$date, format="%d/%m/%y")

#the graph is plotted based on date and nitrous oxide level
ggplot(df, aes(x = date_class, y = daily_mean_nox)) + geom_line() + 
  xlab("Feb 2017- Sep 2017 \nFig(1)") + ylab("nitrous oxides levels (ug/m3)") + # x and y axis labels
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b") + # y aixs values format displayed based on months
  ggtitle("London nitrous oxide levels")
```




```{r}
#the dataset is changed to time series data for further analysis
data = ts(df$daily_mean_nox)
```



```{r}
#autocorrelation against lag is plotted in chart
acf(data)
```




```{r}
#the data is differenced at lag 7
seasonal = diff(data, lag = 7)

```

```{r}
#seasonally differenced data is plotted 
plot(seasonal)
```


```{r}
#autocorrelation of seasonally differenced data
acf(seasonal)
```


```{r}
#partial autocorrelation of seasonally differenced data
pacf(seasonal, ylim=c(-1,1))
```

```{r}
#ARIMA model with non seasonal AR(1) and seasonal AR(2) parameters 
model = Arima(data, order = c(1,0,0), seasonal = (list(order = c(2,1,0), period = 7)), method = "ML")
model
```

```{r}
# residuals of the model
residuals = residuals(model)
# residuals chart
plot(residuals)
```

```{r}
#autocorrelation plot for residuals
acf(residuals)
```



```{r}
#Fitted graph of the model
ggplot(df, aes(x =date_class )) + geom_line(aes(y = model$x), color = 'blue') + geom_line(aes(y = fitted(model)), color = 'red') + xlab("Feb 2017- Sep 2017 \nFig(1)") + ylab("nitrous oxides levels (ug/m3)") + scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b") + ggtitle("London nitrous oxide levels")  
```


















Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
