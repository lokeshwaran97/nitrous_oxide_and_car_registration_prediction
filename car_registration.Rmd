## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Load the libraries 
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#Load the data
df = read.csv("eng_car_reg.csv")
```



```{r}
#The graph of car registrations over years based on four quarters in a year
ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = no_new_regs, color = quarter)) + geom_line() + labs(y = "car registrations (in thousands)", color = "Quarter", x = "Year")+ ggtitle("Car registrations in England from 2001 to 2022")
```

```{r}
#dataset is converted into time series data
data = ts(df$no_new_reg,start=c(2001,1),frequency=4)

```




```{r}
#time series data is plotted
plot(data, ylab = "Car Registrations", xlab = "Year")
title(main = "Car registrations in England from 2001 to 2022")
```



```{r}
#autocorrelation agains the lag is plotted
acf(data)
```



```{r}
# the data is differenced at lag 4 
seasonal = diff(data, lag = 4)

```


```{r}
# the differenced data at lag 4 is plotted
plot(seasonal, xlab="Year", ylab="car registred")
title(main = "Car registred data differenced at lag 4")
```


```{r}
#the ACF and PACF were plotted against the lag

#P = Order of the seasonal AR part of the model

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
